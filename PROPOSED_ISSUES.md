# Proposed GitHub Issues for simple-superres-cifar10

## Overview
This document lists the top 10 highest-impact actionable issues for the simple-superres-cifar10 repository. The repository is currently a minimal placeholder with only a README file and lacks core implementation, documentation, tests, CI/CD, and project infrastructure.

- Core functionality is completely missing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement a neural network model for super-resolution (e.g., SRCNN, ESPCN, or similar)
- [ ] Create model architecture in a dedicated `model.py` or `models/` directory
- [ ] Support CIFAR-10 dataset (32x32) as input
- [ ] Implement upsampling to higher resolution (e.g., 64x64 or 128x128)
- [ ] Include model configuration options (layers, filters, upsampling factor)
- [ ] Add model summary/documentation in code comments

---

## 2. Add Training Script with CIFAR-10 Dataset Integration
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `P0`, `Effort: L`

## 3. Create Comprehensive README Documentation
**Labels:** `docs`, `P0`, `Effort: M`

**Rationale:**
- Current `README.md` (lines 1-2) contains only title and one Japanese sentence

- Dependencies are undefined, making the project non-reproducible
- Essential for environment setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
- [ ] Include specific versions for reproducibility (PyTorch/TensorFlow, NumPy, Pillow, etc.)
- [ ] Add Python version requirement (e.g., Python >= 3.8)
- [ ] Consider adding `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` for package installation
- [ ] Document how to install dependencies in README

---

## 5. Implement Inference and Evaluation Script
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `P1`, `Effort: M`

**Rationale:**
- No inference or evaluation code exists
- Users need a way to test trained models on new images
- Essential for validating model performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `inference.py` or `evaluate.py` script
- [ ] Support loading pre-trained model weights
- [ ] Implement single image and batch inference
- [ ] Add evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM, MSE)
- [ ] Generate and save super-resolution output images
- [ ] Include visualization of results (side-by-side comparison)
- [ ] Add command-line interface for easy usage

---

## 6. Add Unit Tests and Test Infrastructure
**Labels:** `test`, `P1`, `Effort: M`

**Rationale:**
- No test files or test directory exists in the repository
- Testing is critical for code quality and reliability
- Prevents regressions during development

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `tests/` directory structure
- [ ] Add tests for model architecture (forward pass, output shapes)
- [ ] Test data preprocessing and augmentation functions
- [ ] Test training loop components (loss computation, metrics)
- [ ] Test inference pipeline with sample data
- [ ] Add pytest or unittest configuration
- [ ] Achieve at least 70% code coverage
- [ ] Document how to run tests in README

---

## 7. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
**Labels:** `ci`, `P1`, `Effort: M`

**Rationale:**
- No `.github/workflows/` directory or CI configuration exists
- Automated testing and linting would improve code quality
- Essential for maintaining code standards

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for continuous integration
- [ ] Add automated testing on pull requests and commits
- [ ] Implement linting checks (flake8, pylint, or black)
- [ ] Add type checking with mypy (optional)
- [ ] Test on multiple Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10+)
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Configure automated dependency updates (Dependabot)

---

## 8. Add Data Preprocessing and Augmentation Module
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `P2`, `Effort: M`

**Rationale:**
- No data handling code exists
- Proper preprocessing is critical for super-resolution quality
- Augmentation improves model generalization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `data.py` or `data/` module for data handling
- [ ] Implement downsampling function for creating low-res inputs

- [ ] Support different downsampling methods (bicubic, bilinear, nearest)
- [ ] Implement custom PyTorch Dataset or TensorFlow data pipeline
- [ ] Add data normalization and denormalization utilities
- [ ] Include data loading with configurable batch size and workers

## 9. Implement Model Checkpointing and Experiment Tracking
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `perf`, `P2`, `Effort: S`

- [ ] Create checkpoints directory structure
- [ ] Document checkpoint format and usage

## 10. Add Security Best Practices and Input Validation
**Labels:** `security`, `P2`, `Effort: S`

**Rationale:**
- No security considerations in place (no code exists yet)
- Future code should follow security best practices
- Important for safe file handling and user input

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Validate all user inputs (file paths, hyperparameters)
- [ ] Implement safe file operations (check file types, sizes)
- [ ] Add input sanitization for command-line arguments
- [ ] Use secure random number generation for reproducibility
- [ ] Avoid hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- [ ] Add `.gitignore` for data files, checkpoints, and secrets
- [ ] Document security considerations in README
- [ ] Consider adding security scanning in CI (e.g., bandit)

## Implementation Sequence Recommendation

1. **Phase 1 - Foundation:** Issues #4, #3 (get dependencies and docs in place)
2. **Phase 2 - Core Features:** Issues #1, #2, #8 (build the model and training)
3. **Phase 3 - Validation:** Issues #5, #6 (add inference and tests)
4. **Phase 4 - Infrastructure:** Issues #7, #9, #10 (CI/CD, tracking, security)

This phased approach ensures the project becomes functional quickly while building proper infrastructure incrementally.
